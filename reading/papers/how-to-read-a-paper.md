## ABSTRACT


This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for
reading research papers.


## 1. INTRODUCTION

Learning to efficiently read a paper is a critical but rarely taught
skill.


## 2. THE THREE-PASS APPROACH

The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets
you grasp the paper's content, but not its details. The third pass helps you
understand the paper in depth.


### 2.1 The first pass

The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird's-eye view of the paper. You can
also decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about
five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:

 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
 2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
 3. Glance at the mathematical content (if any) to determine the underlying
    theoretical foundations
 4. Read the conclusions
 5. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already
    read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the *five* Cs:

 1. *Category*: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An
    analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
 2. *Context*: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical
    bases were used to analyze the problem?
 3. *Correctness*: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
 4. *Contributions*: What are the paper's main contributions?
 5. *Clarity*: Is the paper well written?


### 2.2 The second pass

In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details
such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key points, or to make comments
in the margins, as you read. Dominik Grusemann from Uni Augsburg
suggests that you "note down terms you didn't understand, or questions
you may want to ask the author." ...

The second pass should take up to an hour for an experienced reader.
After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper.
You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with
supporting evidence, to someone else.  This level of detail is
appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in
your research speciality. ...

You can now choose to: (a) set the paper aside, hoping you don’t need to
understand the material to be successful in your career, (b) return to
the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or (c)
persevere and go on to the third pass.


### 2.3 The third pass

The key to the third pass is to attempt to *virtually re-implement* the
paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create
the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can
easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden
failings and assumptions. ...

You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
...

This pass can take many hours for beginners and more than an hour or two
even for an experienced reader. At the end of this pass, you should be
able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as
well as be able to identify its strong and weak points.
