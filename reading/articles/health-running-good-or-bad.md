- Marcelo Gleiser is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist — and a
  professor of natural philosophy, physics and astronomy at Dartmouth
  College.
- Leisure-Time Running Reduces All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality
  Risk ([LEE][])
- Conclusions: Running, even 5 to 10 min/day and at slow speeds <6
  miles/h, is associated with markedly reduced risks of death from all
  causes and cardiovascular disease. This study may motivate healthy but
  sedentary individuals to begin and continue running for substantial
  and attainable mortality benefits. ([LEE][])
