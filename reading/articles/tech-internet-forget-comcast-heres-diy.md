Spanish engineer Ramon Roca got tired of waiting for telecom companies to
wire his town -- so he did it himself. ...

So why do people like me eagerly journey to Gurb? Because it's the birthplace
of [Guifi.net](https://guifi.net/), one of the world's most important
experiments in telecommunications. ...

Guifi exists because a technically savvy local man, Ramon Roca, got tired of
waiting for Telefonica, the Spanish telecom giant, to provide Internet access
to the people of his community. ...

Guifi started with a single wifi node in 2004. Today there are more than
30,000 working nodes, including some fiber connections, with thousands more
in the planning stages. ...

"What they've built is extraordinary," says Sascha Meinrath, an open Internet
activist, professor of telecommunications at Penn State University, and
director of the telecom-focused think tank [X-LAB](http://thexlab.org/).
...

The first node went live in the early summer of 2004, when Roca turned on a
router with a directional antenna he'd installed at the top of a tall
building near the local government headquarters. ...

The network connected to high-capacity fiber optic lines, to handle the
growing demand, and later connected to a major "peering" connection to the
global Internet backbone that provides massive bandwidth.
([Peering](http://arstechnica.com/features/2008/09/peering-and-transit/) is a
voluntary exchange of traffic from one network to another.) ...

Roca concluded that the network needed a parent organization. They created a
not-for-profit entity, the Guifi.net Foundation, under which a sound
governance structure could be created and maintained. The foundation employs
a small team (Roca remains an unpaid volunteer and board member). ...

The Guifi Foundation isn't the paid provider of most Internet service to
end-user (home and business) customers. That role falls to more than 20
for-profit internet service providers that operate on the overall platform.
The ISPs share infrastructure costs according to how much demand they put on
the overall system. They pay fees to the foundation for its services --
a key source of funding for the overall project. ...

WiFi routers are cheap on a per-household basis, so deploying the WiFi mesh
has required modest capital costs but significant operating costs. Deploying
fiber to a home or business is expensive, especially in rural areas,
requiring much higher up-front investments.
