David Cameron to quit after UK votes to leave EU
================================================
2016-06-24: BBC: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36615028


The PM had urged the country to vote Remain but was defeated by 52% to
48% despite London, Scotland and Northern Ireland backing staying in.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed it as the UK's "independence day",
while Boris Johnson said the result would not mean "pulling up the
drawbridge". ...

But Boris Johnson, the ex-London mayor and public face of Vote Leave
who is now a front-runner to be next prime minister, said there was
"no need for haste" about severing the UK's ties. He said voters had
"searched in their hearts" and the UK now had a "glorious opportunity"
to pass its own laws, set its own taxes and control its own borders. ...

Flanked by his wife Samantha, Mr Cameron announced shortly after 08:15
BST that he had informed the Queen of his decision to remain in place
for the short term and to then hand over to a new prime minister by
the time of the Conservative conference in October. ...

Britain is set to be the first country to leave the EU since its
formation - but the Leave vote does not immediately mean Britain
ceases to be a member of the 28-nation bloc. ...

Once Article 50 has been triggered a country can not rejoin without
the consent of all member states. ...

In Whitehall and Westminster, there will now begin the massive task of
unstitching the UK from more than 40 years of EU law, deciding which
directives and regulations to keep, amend or ditch.
