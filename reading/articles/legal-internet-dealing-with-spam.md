Notes
-----
- The Information Technology Act, 2000 (also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act)
  is an Act of the Indian Parliament (No 21 of 2000) notified
  on 17 October 2000. It is the primary law in India dealing with
  cybercrime and electronic commerce. It is based on the United Nations
  Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996 (UNCITRAL Model) recommended by
  the General Assembly of United Nations by a resolution dated 30
  January 1997. ([WP-ITA-2000][])
- On 19 November 2012, a 21-year-old girl was arrested from Palghar for posting
  a message on Facebook criticising the shutdown in Mumbai for the funeral of
  Bal Thackeray. Another 20-year-old girl was arrested for "liking" the post.
  They were initially charged under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code
  (hurting religious sentiments) and Section 66A of the IT Act. Later, Section
  295A was replaced by Section 505(2) (promoting enmity between classes). A
  group of Shiv Sena workers vandalised a hospital run by the uncle of one of
  girls. On 31 January 2013, a local court dropped all charges against the
  girls. ([WP-ITA-2000][])
- On 24 March 2015, the Supreme Court of India, gave the verdict that Section
  66A is unconstitutional in the Shreya Singhal v. Union of India case. It
  however rejected the plea to strike down Sections 69A and 79. The Court said
  that the offences defined under the law were "open-ended, undefined and
  vague" and that "public's right to know" is directly affected by it.
