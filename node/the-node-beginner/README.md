This directory contains examples I wrote while I was studying Node.js
from [*The Node Beginner Book*](http://www.nodebeginner.org/),
2014-01-02 by Manuel Kiessling.

The examples in this directory were run using node v4.2.1 downloaded
from <https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.1/node-v4.2.1-linux-x64.tar.gz> on a
Debian 8.0 (Jessie) system.
